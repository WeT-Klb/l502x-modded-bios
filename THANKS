= Thiblizz's L502X Modded BIOS -- Thanks/credits file =

My modded BIOS is a continuation of the L502X modding project, which was originally initiated
by kasar. Many people further helped this project by submitting bug reports and suggestions.
Thanks to the community!

Special thanks should go out to the My Digital Life community (https://forums.mydigitallife.info/),
especially AndyP and CodeRush for their amazing tools, without their contribution,
the project would never have got off the ground. Keep up the good work guys.
